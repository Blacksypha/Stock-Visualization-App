# Prerequisites

- IDE e.g. Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code
- Node (v7.x, v6.x, or v4.x should all be fine)
- npm (v2.x)
- git (v2.x)
- clone the goldmansachs/EngineeringEssentials GitHub repository

# Environment Setup

- We will assume you have the repository in the root of a drive, e.g. H:\
- File structure will look like: H:\EngineeringEssentials\techCurriculum\ui\starter_code\cards-app\...
- Run the following commands to get set up with the boiler plate code
    
    > H:\...>npm install -g create-react-app
        * This globally installs Facebook's create-react-app tool
    > H:\EngineeringEssentials\techCurriculum\ui\starter_code\cards-app>npm install
        * Installs the initial dependencies for this project (mainly vanilla React libraries)

# Test your setup 

    > H:\EngineeringEssentials\techCurriculum\ui\starter_code\cards-app>npm start

    You should see a barebones page that says "Hello World"
